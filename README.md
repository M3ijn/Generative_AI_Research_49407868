- **Version Control:** Commit messages should be concise yet descriptive (e.g., "Added initial survey data analysis script"). We use branching (e.g., the `Analysis_development` branch) for new features and merge them back into `main` after review.
- **Collaboration:** If you're a team member, please ensure you follow the repository guidelines and maintain the folder structure when adding or modifying files.
- **Issue Tracking:** Use GitHub issues to notify the team about tasks or problems related to the project. Assign issues to the relevant team members as needed.
